### Welcome to my Image Classification App

Since I had to install and use TensorFlow in my app, it is too large to host on Heroku's free-tier account. Therefore, I made this demo video to show how my app works and hosted it on YouTube for free :).  If you're curious, then click on the link below to see my demo video.

#### There are two major components for building this web app:  

1. the image classification model:

I utilized TensorFlow's Keras API to work with MobileNets - a class of light weight deep convolutional neural networks that are vastly smaller in size and faster in performance than many other popular models.

2. the user-interfacing web app:

I built this web app using Flask - a web framework written in Python.
