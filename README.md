## Welcome to my Image Classification App

There are two major components for building this web app:  

1. the image classification model  

I utilized TensorFlow's Keras API to work with MobileNets - a class of light weight deep convolutional neural networks that are vastly smaller in size and faster in performance than many other popular models.

2. the user-interfacing web app:

I built this web app using Flask - a web framework written in Python.
